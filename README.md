Check Unique Values for each variable.
This loop will iterate over each column in data.columns.tolist() and print a statement indicating the number of unique values in that column.

# Data Wrangling: 
This section focuses on several data transformations and preparations are performed to make the dataset analysis-ready
Convert 'datetime' column to datetime object:
The 'datetime' column is converted from a string format to a datetime object using the pd.to_datetime() function.
Extract date and time features:
Additional features are extracted from the 'datetime' column using the .dt accessor of the datetime object. The 'year', 'month', and 'day', features are created,
The 'day_of_week' feature is also created using the .dayofweek property of the datetime object, which returns the day of the week as an integer (Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6).
Drop unnecessary columns:
The 'datetime' column, which is no longer needed after extracting the date and time features, is dropped from the dataset using the .drop() method with axis=1.
Convert categorical columns to categorical data type:
The 'Seasons', 'Holiday', and 'Functioning Day' columns are converted to the categorical data type using the .astype('category') method.
Check unique values for categorical variables:
The unique values for the categorical variables 'Seasons', 'Holiday', and 'Functioning Day' are printed using the .unique() method.


# What all manipulations have you done and insights you found?
By performing these data transformations, the code prepares the dataset for further analysis by converting datetime-related information into separate features and ensuring appropriate data types for categorical variables.

# Hypothesis Testing
The code provided demonstrates three hypothesis tests performed on the dataset.
1) Hypothesis Test : Comparison of Mean Bike Rentals between Functional and     Non-Functional Days.
-Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between functional and non-functional days.
-Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between functional and non-functional days.
-Method: Independent t-test (two-sample t-test) is used to compare the  Mean Bike Rentals between Functional and Non-Functional Days.
-Result: The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between functional and non-functional days. The alternative hypothesis suggests that there is a significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between these two types of days.
2)Hypothesis Test : Comparison of Mean Bike Rentals between Holidays and Non-Holidays.
Null hypothesis: The mean number of bike rentals between holidays and non-holidays is not significantly different.
Alternative hypothesis: The mean number of bike rentals between holidays and non-holidays is significantly different.
-Method: Independent t-test (two-sample t-test) is used to compare the Mean Bike Rentals between Holidays and Non-Holidays.
-Result : The p-value is used to interpret the results. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05 (assuming a significance level of 0.05), indicating a significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between functional and non-functional days. If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, the null hypothesis is not rejected, implying that there is no significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between functional and non-functional days.
3) Hypothesis Test: Comparison of Mean bike rental during daytime and nighttime.
Null hypothesis: The mean number of bike rentals during daytime and nighttime is not significantly different.
Alternative hypothesis: The mean number of bike rentals during daytime and nighttime is significantly different.
-Method: Independent t-test (two-sample t-test) is used to compare the Mean bike rental during daytime and nighttime.
-Result : The resulting p-value from the t-test is compared to a significance level (usually 0.05) to make a conclusion. If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference. Otherwise, if the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference.
# Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing
The code provided demonstrates several steps of feature engineering.
Handling missing values : There are no missing values in given dataset.
Handling outliers :In this case, the code indicates that there are a few outliers present in the 'Rented Bike Count' variable. However, it states that these outliers will not be removed at the moment, as they could be important data points.
Categorical Encoding : 
One-Hot Encoding: By using one-hot encoding, we transform categorical variables into a binary format, where each category is represented by a separate column. This allows machine learning models to work with categorical data by treating each category as a binary indicator variable.
The resulting dummy variables are binary (1 or 0), indicating the presence or absence of a specific category in the original feature. This encoding preserves the information about the categories without introducing any numerical ordering or bias.
One-hot encoding is especially useful when dealing with categorical variables that do not have an inherent order or when all categories are equally important. It ensures that each category is considered as a separate entity, enabling the model to learn distinct relationships between the categories and the target variable.
4) Feature Manipulation:Feature manipulation plays a crucial role in improving the accuracy and generalizability of machine learning models.
Feature engineering refers to creating new features or transforming existing features to extract more meaningful information. This process leverages domain knowledge, intuition, and data analysis techniques to derive features that can better capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
Removing irrelevant or unnecessary columns from the dataset can be beneficial for the machine learning model. It helps in reducing noise, improving computational efficiency, and focusing on the most relevant features that contribute to the target variable.
5) Feature Selection: It involves selecting the most relevant and informative features from the available set of features. By selecting the right set of features, we can reduce the complexity of the model, improve interpretability, and mitigate the risk of overfitting.
The purpose of this code snippet is to select the top 5 features based on the f_regression scores, which measure the relationship between each feature and the target variable. By selecting the most relevant features, you aim to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the model's performance.
# Data Transformation : 
By applying this transformation, you can achieve a more symmetric and normalized distribution of the 'Rented Bike Count' variable, which can be beneficial for certain statistical analyses or machine learning models that assume normality or require input variables to have a specific range or distribution.
Handling Imbalanced data :
To address the class imbalance, various techniques can be employed, such as oversampling (generating synthetic examples for minority classes) or undersampling (reducing the number of instances from the majority class). These techniques aim to balance the dataset and provide more representative training data for the model.
the observed class imbalance in the dataset indicates the need for addressing this issue to ensure fair and accurate predictions when training a machine learning model on this data.
Unsampling: This approach of upsampling the minority class aims to balance the class distribution and provide equal representation of both classes during the model training process. By having a balanced dataset, the machine learning model can learn from all classes effectively and produce more accurate and unbiased predictions.
the code snippet currently updates the 'train_df' DataFrame with the upsampled data. It's important to consider how this impacts the overall data handling and model training process, such as whether further splitting of the dataset into training and validation sets is needed and whether additional preprocessing steps are required.
# Data Scaling :
This scaling process ensures that the variables are on a similar scale, which can be beneficial for various machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of variables.
the 'train_df' DataFrame exists, and the specified columns ('Temperature(Â°C)', 'Wind speed (m/s)', 'Humidity(%)') are present. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the scaling is performed consistently across the training, validation, and test sets, if applicable, to avoid data leakage and maintain consistency in the scaling process.
# Dimesionality Reduction: 
It does not require dimensionality reduction, you can proceed without applying such techniques. 
# Data Splitting :
Splitting the data into training and testing sets is an important step in machine learning. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The choice of the splitting ratio depends on various factors, such as the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the analysis. In this case, a test_size of 0.2 indicates an 80:20 split, which is a commonly used ratio. Adjusting the test_size value allows you to control the trade-off between the size of the training set and the size of the testing set.
Handling Imbalanced Dataset :
# ML Model - 1---RandomForestRegressor
Basically, this code provides a basic implementation of a Random Forest regression model for prediction and evaluation. You can further enhance the model by tuning hyperparameters, performing cross-validation, and exploring other evaluation metrics based on your specific needs and the characteristics of the dataset.
 A Random Forest Regressor object is created with 100 estimators (decision trees) using the `RandomForestRegressor` class from `sklearn.ensemble`.
- The model is trained on the training data using the `fit` method.
- Predictions are made on the testing data using the `predict` method.
- Mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared are calculated to evaluate the model's performance using the `mean_squared_error` and `r2_score` functions from `sklearn.metrics`.
- The MSE and R-squared values are printed to assess the model's performance.
 R-square value is 0.9801.
This suggests that the model is a good fit for the data and is performing well in predicting the number of bikes rented during a given hour.
# ML Model - 2: XGBRegressor

- XGBRegressor is a machine learning model based on the gradient boosting algorithm using the XGBoost library.
- Similar to the Random Forest Regressor, the dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- An XGBRegressor object is created with 100 estimators using the `XGBRegressor` class from `xgboost`.
- The model is trained on the training data.
- Predictions are made on the testing data.
- MSE and R-squared are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
- The evaluation metrics are plotted using a bar chart.

# ML Model - 3: GradientBoostingRegressor

- GradientBoostingRegressor is another machine learning model based on the gradient boosting algorithm from the `sklearn.ensemble` module.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- A GradientBoostingRegressor object is created with 100 estimators and a learning rate of 0.1.
- The model is trained on the training data.
- Predictions are made on the testing data.
- MSE, mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
- The evaluation metrics are printed and plotted using a bar chart.



For all three models, the evaluation metrics provide an indication of how well the models perform. Lower values of MSE and MAE indicate better predictive accuracy, while a higher R-squared value (closer to 1) indicates a better fit of the model to the data. The bar charts visualize the evaluation metric scores for easy comparison between the models.

# Conclusion : 
The combination of the dataset, machine learning techniques, and analysis provides valuable insights into the factors driving bike rental demand and demonstrates the power of machine learning in understanding and predicting complex phenomena.
